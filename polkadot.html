Gavin Wood, Thiel Fellow Robert Habermeier and Peter Czaban are the co-founders of Polkadot. Gavin Wood is a co-founder of Ethereum and served as the Ethereum Foundation's first Chief Technology Officer.<br><br>

While developing Ethereum and developing the new Ethereum 2.0 specification that would include sharding, Dr. Wood and his team began pondering the sharding hurdles a blockchain would face. From initial conception to a white paper, it took him about four months to come up with a vision for a heterogeneous multi-chain framework, the Polkadot Protocol. Wood released the Polkadot white paper on November 14, 2016.<br><br>

The technology surrounding Polkadot is set to help support the decentralization of the web, a concept pioneered by Dr. Wood and coined ‘Web 3.0’. The subsequent innovations that followed Polkadot were Substrate, a framework to efficiently build your own blockchains; and the “canary” Kusama network that is independent of Polkadot but runs on early, unaudited versions of the same software as a proving ground for bleeding-edge technology.<br><br>

Crowdfunding
Polkadot's first token sale closed on October 27, 2017 raising a total of 485,331 ETH (Ether, the currency of the Ethereum blockchain).<br><br>
